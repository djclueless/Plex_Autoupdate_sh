You will need to create two .txt files in the same directory as the script for this to work.

x-plex_token.txt

plex_version.txt


For plexpass you need to paste your plex token in the x-plex-token.txt file. To locate this token google "x-plex token". The plex_version file auto populates to keep track of current version that is installed.

sh plex_auto_update.sh
